# Ransomware_for_encryption
I have created a ransomware to simply demonstrate how easy it is to encrypt and decrypt files.

what is a ransomware?
-Ransomware is a type of malicious software that encrypts your files, making them inaccessible to you. The attackers then demand a ransom payment, usually in the form of cryptocurrency, in exchange for the decryption key. If you don't pay the ransom, you may never be able to access your files again.

requirements:
- i usally prefer to use linux terminal here, so it will be easy to create files or run python scripts to demonstration my internship project.

Process:
- i made a directory and inside that i created 4 files with contents inside it.
- then i created a python script to run that in the users directory so that it can encrypt all the files inside the directory, note: here it only encrypts files.
- now once all the files are encrypted then the attacker demands bitcoin in order to decrypt users files, in order to decrypt it he needs to have a special key which the attacker has.
- so when you provide him with bitcoins then the attacker will give you a secret phase, by using that secret phase you can get the key to decrypt all your files, this is the overall working of our ransomware.

All though ransomwares are very complex and tough but here i am just showcasing how it is done in real world.
